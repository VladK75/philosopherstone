Philosopherstone - a fork of Diamond, with several algorithms fixed and improved. It is decendent of Novacoin/PPCoin with Pow/PoS. It combines the great features from Luckycoin (random blocks) and Florincoin (transaction message). 

Proof of stake coin is more resilient to 51% attack. Since 51% hashpower is not enough to execute a 51% attack. The attackers must also have at least 51% stake.

Philosopherstone provides annual interest rate of 50%, for stakes that are not moved. This equivalent to 3.44% monthly interest. PoS blocks will be generated if the stake is hold for more than 5 days.

	- Each normal block has 64 Philosopherstone
	- 2 minute block time
	- Difficulty retargets every block 
	- mining payout will be halved every 3 months (or every 64800 blocks)
	- Expected total mined coins will be 8,891,840 Philosopherstones
	- 4 confirmations for transaction
	- 50 confirmations for minted blocks
	- Support transaction message

	- Random bonus blocks are (on average):
		- 1 superblock every day of 512 Philosopherstones 
		- 1 superblock every hour of 128 Philosopherstones (24 such blocks per day)

	- The default ports are 16281(Connect) and 16282(RPC).

To encourage accumulate initial stake, the first 5 days all the payout will be doubled.
