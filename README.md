Philosopher Stones - a fork of Diamond, with several algorithms fixed and improved. It is descendent of Novacoin/PPCoin with Pow/PoS. It combines the great features from Luckycoin (random blocks) and Florincoin (transaction message). 


Philosopher Stones provide annual interest rate of 50%, for stakes that are not moved. This equivalent to 3.44% monthly interest. PoS blocks will be generated if the stake is held for more than 5 days. You will generally start to see interest payments around 5-10 days after deposit into your wallet.

	- Each normal block has 64 Philosopherstones
	- 2 minute block time
	- Difficulty retargets every block 
	- Mining payout will be halved every 3 months (every 64800 blocks)
	- Expected total mined coins will be <much less than> 8,891,840 Philosopherstones
	- 4 confirmations for transaction
	- 50 confirmations for minted blocks
	- Support transaction message
	- No '0' value PoS blocks
	- ASIC Resistance

	- Random bonus blocks are (on average):
		- 1 superblock every day of 512 Philosopherstones (1 in 720 Chance)
		- 1 superblock every hour of 128 Philosopherstones (1 in 30 Chance)

	- The default ports are 16281(Connect) and 16282(RPC).

Philosopherstone is also long-term energy efficient due to the nature of Proof of Stake slowly overtaking Proof of Work mining.

Proof of Stake quickly overcame Proof of work blocks, and as such, total mined coins will be much less than original estimations of 8.891 million.

First 5 days all the payouts were doubled.
