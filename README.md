Philosopherstone - a fork of Diamond, with several algorithms fixed and improved. It is decendent of Novacoin/PPCoin with Pow/PoS. It combines the great features from Luckycoin (random blocks) and Florincoin (transaction message). 


Philosopherstone provides annual interest rate of 50%, for stakes that are not moved. This equivalent to 3.44% monthly interest. PoS blocks will be generated if the stake is held for more than 5 days. You will generally start to see interest payments around 5-10 days after deposit into your wallet.

	- Each normal block has 64 Philosopherstone
	- 2 minute block time
	- Difficulty retargets every block 
	- Mining payout will be halved every 3 months (every 64800 blocks)
	- Expected total mined coins will be <much less than> 8,891,840 Philosopherstones
	- 4 confirmations for transaction
	- 50 confirmations for minted blocks
	- Support transaction message
	- No '0' value PoS blocks

	- Random bonus blocks are (on average):
		- 1 superblock every day of 512 Philosopherstones 
		- 1 superblock every hour of 128 Philosopherstones (24 such blocks per day)

	- The default ports are 16281(Connect) and 16282(RPC).

Philosopherstone is also long-term energy efficent due to the nature of Proof of Stake slowly overtaking Proof of Work mining.

Proof of Stake quickly overcame Proof of work blocks, and as such, total mined coins will be much less than original extimation of 8.891 million.

To encourage accumulate initial stake, the first 5 days all the payout will be doubled.
